# Mining ontologically-generalized graph patterns


Mining graph patterns is already a challenging enough task and adding a domain ontology (DO) to enable intelligible patterns at varying abstraction levels only compounds the difficulties dues to the combinatorial nature of the pattern space. 

Existing approaches would either trim pattern expressiveness or split the task into pure graph mining and label specializations steps. Here we state the problem of mining unrestricted *ontologically-generalized graph patterns* (OGP) and clarify technical challenges brought by the DO. 

We then present *jCan*, a novel two-step OGP miner whose first step relies on the *gSpan* plain graph miner while second one is a label refining method performing a non-redundant traversal of the DO-induced pattern space. The method relies on an original extension of the canonical form for patterns used by *gSpan*. We report here the outcome of a practical evaluation of *jCan*  and discuss its limitations.
